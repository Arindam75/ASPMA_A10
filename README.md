## Sound Description using Essentia & Freesound
### Assigment 10: Audio Signal Processing for Music Applications

This repository contains the code for the last project of the Audio Signal Processing for Music Applications (from Coursera).
It is about sound description using Essentia library and classification with simple machine learning algorithms.

Note that the scripts soundDownload.py and soundAnalysis.py are downloaded directly from the course, but are modified for the 
purposes of this project.
The file freesound.py can be found in their GitHub repository: https://github.com/MTG/freesound-python.
